# About Remick Travel Planner

Welcome to my Remick Travel Planner SPA! I created this app as my Capstone project for the Flatiron School using a React-Ruby on Rails API. I've intended for this application to be used by Users interested in booking their next vacation - whether their minds are decided on the destination or if they could use some inspiration.

I have built in authentication functionality so that new Users can sign up or so existing Users can sign in. You will be prompted to sign up for an account in order to access the majority of what my app has to offer. Once signed up and logged in, Users can either explore the 'Get Inspired' tab to check out enticing destinations to visit, some favorite hotel chains included in the pre-packaged trips offered by the app's travel agents, or Users can research Travel Agents available for booking in the 'Find an Agent' tab. Every Agent has their own 'show' page inclusive of their contact info, packages offered, and a place to view and leave reviews.

Upon booking any pre-packaged trip with an available agent, a User can easily review the details of their upcoming vacation or cancel any booking from their 'My Trips' tab.

# Beyond This SPA

Over the course of the last few months that I have learned to code with the Flatiron School, I've liked to include a short blurb on ways I could imagine one day expanding upon these projects. In the case of Remick Travel Planner, with more time and research I'd love to build in the capability to sign up not only as a User, but also as a Travel Agent who possesses the power to customize their own trip packages bookable by ordinary Users. I'm interested in exploring what would go into accomplishing this kind of authorization/authentication when signing up and logging in.
